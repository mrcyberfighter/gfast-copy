gfast-copy
==========

gfast-copy copy comes from the idea to let a binary copy big files,

faster than the O.S.

I often copy videos files from left to right and from right to left.

gfast-copy is build on the top of the command-line tool: fast-copy.

.. note::

  fast-copy is written in UNIX fashion:

  A tool which do one single task but do it well.

  According the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface X for UNIX) standard.

============
Installation
============

  $ ./configure       # Perform a system check.
  Then
  $ make              # Build the program(s).
  $ make strip        # Remove unneeded symbols.
  Finally
  $ sudo make install # Install the program(s).

Enjoy fast copying chunks using (g)fast-copy.

:warning: On MacOSX maybe you may must type ``$ chmod +x install.sh``
          after ``$ make`` for installing.

===========
Portability
===========

-----
Linux
-----

All works well with the tar-ball.

A *.deb package is provided for DEBIAN family distributions.

A *.rpm package is provided for RPM family distributions.

Windows

Thanks to the bugzilla-gnome team for their help.

Without them I would not provide you a gfast-copy auto-extractable file.

:note: But you can build it, using the tar-ball for yourself into the MSYS2 or Cygwin environment.

So an auto-extractable *.exe file is available.

------
MacOSX
------

It works on MacOSX Using the tar-ball for installation.

:note: An entry into the /Application is done by the building system.

Read the TODO and/or the HACKME file.

:note: You can download the file you want at <http://www.open-source-projects.net/gfast-copy/gfast-copy>.
