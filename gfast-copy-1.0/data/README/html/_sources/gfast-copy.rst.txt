:program: :program:`gfast-copy` (a graphical fast chunk file copy program.)

:author: Eddie Brüggemann <mrcyberfighter@gmail.com>

:language: **C**

:version: |version|

:release: |today|

------------
Introduction
------------

:program:`gfast-copy` stands for **Graphical** **Fast** **Copy** and it is build on a :ref:`very fast copying algorithm <fast-copy-algorithm>`.

.. note:: This tool is implemented into the UNIX spirit:

  A single program which can do an unique task but do it well.

  It copy a single file to a destination in a practice way.

  As fast as it can !!!

:program:`gfast-copy` only provides a graphical interface for the :program:`fast-copy` command-line tool,

that I have implement. Which can copy a file like a film (Around ``700`` **Mo**) in few seconds.

.. note:: I have implement it because I often copy videos from a location to another:

 Per example from the folder named ``ToWatch`` to the folder ``Seen``.

 Or \*.iso images from the folder ``Download`` to the folder ``ISO_Collection``.

 Because the :abbr:`O.S (Operating System)` can be slow by chunk copy operations.

------------------------------------
Graphical User Interface description
------------------------------------

~~~~~~~~~
Interface
~~~~~~~~~

You get to verticaly align buttons:

1. ``Source``

2. ``Destination``

Use the ``Source`` labeled button to set *the file to copy* :guilabel:`&Source` (:kbd:`Ctrl + S`).

  This will display the *basename* of the file to copy *onto the button*.

Use the ``Destination`` labeled button to set *the file destination* :guilabel:`&Destination` (:kbd:`Ctrl + D`).

  This will display the basename you have choose for the destination file.

And at they are 2 icons buttons:

+ :guilabel:`&Remove` source file toggle button (:kbd:`Ctrl + R`).

+ Run copying (:kbd:`Ctrl + Return`).

:note: Take a look at my self-builded GtkSmartIconButton widgets.

Once the copying done, the button contains their original string and icons.

~~~~~~~~
Menu bar
~~~~~~~~

You get a menu bar too with few menu buttons.

1. Files

  + :guilabel:`Files --> Set &source file` (:kbd:`Ctrl + S`).

  + :guilabel:`Files --> Set &destination file` (:kbd:`Ctrl + D`).

  + :guilabel:`Files --> Run copying` (:kbd:`Ctrl + Return`).

  + :guilabel:`&Quit` (:kbd:`Ctrl + Q`).

2. Configuration

  + :guilabel:`Configuration --> Light theme`.

  + :guilabel:`Configuration --> Dark theme`.

  these are radiobuttons to choose your theming.

  + :guilabel:`Configuration --> Delete source file` (:kbd:`Ctrl + R`).

3. Info ?

  + :guilabel:`Info ? --> Read me` (:kbd:`Ctrl + N`). 

  + :guilabel:`Info ? --> &About` (:kbd:`Ctrl + A`).

Thanks to the gnome-bugzilla team which help to provide you a version of (g)fast-copy.

Without their help only the MSYS2 and Cygwin users would be able to launch (g)fast-copy.
