.. warning::

  Into the right term of the word, criminals are not welcome anyway.

  + They should be told that a computer is a tool not a f@cking machine.

  And that they should stop their shit before it's too late in jail !

  + We work for a better world and not for being annoyed by criminals.

The source are copied into the $(pkgdatadir)/src folder

and a Makefile is provided for hacking the code of gfast-copy.

---

If you fear that someone change your program

the hash is computed at build time

and copy into $(pkgdatadir) too.

Simply remove the source if you get anxious about this.

Thanks for feedback if you change and/or enhance this little tool(s).

---

:note: $(pkgdatadir) is equal to /usr(/local)/share/prgname.

MacOSX

You can help by explain me how to build a package for MacOSX

for lambda user.

or building and distributing one yourself according the GPLv3 license.

Think to notify me by mail if you do this: <mrcyberfighter@gmail.com>.

Every tip, knowledges, ideas, and so on... in this way is welcome.

--------------------
Separating the tools
--------------------

Take look at the configure.ac file to see that I have try to implement

2 options:

--disable-graphical-tool

and

--disable-cmdline-tool

to give to the configure script.

Without success, sorry.
